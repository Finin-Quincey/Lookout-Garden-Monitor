# ü¶ä Lookout Garden Monitor
Code for my final year project (MIDP module, year 4 IDE) to design and build a device for deterring unwanted animals from urban gardens. This repository contains the Python code that runs on a Raspberry Pi inside the prototype device, performing object recognition on the video feed from the camera to determine which animals are present and decide whether to activate the deterrent.

## üêà Specs

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3B
- Ansmann 20.8Ah USB power bank
- SimplyTronics ST-00081 PIR sensor module
- Arducam OV5647 5MP motorised IR-CUT camera (day & night vision)
- 86dB piezo transducer buzzer
- Custom veroboard PCB (see schematic)
- Custom 3D-printed water-resistant housing with velcro straps for mounting

### Software
- Raspbian Buster
- Python 3.7.3
- TensorFlow Lite 2.6
- OpenCV 3.4.6
- pigpio 1.78
